    "### What is the purpose of Python's OOP?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "\n",
    "Object-oriented programming is a programming paradigm that provides a means of structuring programs so that properties and behaviors are bundled into individual objects. In other words, OOP models real-world entities as software objects that have some data associated with them and can perform certain functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another common programming paradigm is procedural programming, which structures a program like a recipe in that it provides a set of steps, in the form of functions and code blocks, that flow sequentially in order to complete a task.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key takeaway is that objects are at the center of object-oriented programming in Python, not only representing the data, as in procedural programming, but in the overall structure of the program as well."

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "\n",
    "The first argument of every class method, including init, is always a reference to the current instance of the class. By convention, this argument is always named self. In the init method, self refers to the newly created object; in other class methods, it refers to the instance whose method was called."
