    "The main difference between Binary file and text file is the format of contents within the the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "And second reason is the extension of the files.\n",
    "\n",
    "The extension of binary file will be .bin and that for text file will be .txt\n",
    "\n",
    "Binary file contains the data in the form of 0 and 1(series of binary values) and text files contains the data in the form of stream of characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general binary files are identified as executable files.But binary files are not in readable form as like text file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Binary files are more efficient. In terms of memory, storing values using numeric formats such as IEEE 754, rather than as text characters, tends to use less memory. \n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, binary formats also offer advantages in terms of speed of access."

    "### What are some scenarios where using text files will be the better option? When would you like to use binary files instead of text files?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "\n",
    "Binary files are faster and easier for a program to read and write than are text files. As long as the file doesnâ€™t need to be read by people or need to be ported to a different type of system, binary files are the best way to store program information. \n",
    "\n",
    "One most common example of binary file is image file is .PNG or .JPG. If one tries open these files using a text editor then, he/she may get unrecognizable characters, but when opened using the supporting image viewer, the file will be shown as a single image. This is because the file is in binary format and contains data in the form of sequence of bytes. When the text editor tries to read these bytes and tries to convert bits into characters, they get undesired special characters and display it to the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "Text can be read by people. It can be ported to a different type of system. Because of simple and standard format to store data, text files are one of the most used file formats for storing textual data and are supported in many applications.\n",
