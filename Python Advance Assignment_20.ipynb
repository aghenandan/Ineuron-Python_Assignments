    "Float is Approximate-number data type, which means that not all values in the data type range can be represented exactly , it round up the values.\n",

    "Float is a single precision (32 bit) floating point data type and decimal is a 128-bit floating point data type.\n",

    "Decimal accurately represent any number within the precision of the decimal format, whereas Float cannot accurately represent all numbers.\n",
