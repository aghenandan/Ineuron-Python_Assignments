    "### What is a probability distribution, exactly? If the values are meant to be random, how can you predict them at all?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "\n",
    "A probability distribution is a statistical function that describes all the possible values and likelihoods that a random variable can take within a given range. \n",
    "\n",
    "This range will be bounded between the minimum and maximum possible values, but precisely where the possible value is likely to be plotted on the probability distribution depends on a number of factors. \n",
    "\n",
    "These factors include the distribution's mean (average), standard deviation, skewness, and kurtosis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the previous data and the occurences of the random event, we can predict the outcome in terms of probabilities."

    "Pseudorandom sequences meet the statistical descriptions of randomness, but in fact arise from an algorithm, such that you can predict every single value. In fact, you simply compute the next value from the previous values in a well-determined way.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pseudorandom sequences are good enough because you can use them to test a system’s response to random input, but at the same time you can perfectly duplicate input sequences, for example to recreate error conditions and so on."
