    "Circular importing means importing the two modules in each other. If suppose we are wokring in MOD1.py file and it is importing some function say F2() from some other module say MOD2.PY file or we can do vice-versa. What will happen is: This will give an import error.\n",

    "Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) is a way of writing expressions commonly found in calculators and Forth-like programming languages. In RPN, an expression is a list of instructions for manipulating data on a stack. The most basic instruction is to push a value onto the stack.\n",

    "\n",
    "Reverse Polish Notation was designed specifically to make computing easier with the more efficient use of a stack. So we can use a stack here to store numbers until they're used, and then each operand will use the top two values of the stack.\n",
