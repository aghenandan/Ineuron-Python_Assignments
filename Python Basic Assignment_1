1. In the below elements which of them are values or an expression? eg:- values can be integer or string and expressions will be mathematical operators.
* 
'hello'
-87.8
- 
/ 
+	
6 

Ans:
* --> Expression (Mathematical Operator)
'hello' --> Value (String)
-87.8 --> Value (Float)
- --> Expression (Mathematical Operator)
/ --> Expression (Mathematical Operator)
+ --> Expression (Mathematical Operator)
6 --> Value (Integer)

2. What is the difference between string and variable?

Ans:
String: 1. Anything enclosed within quotes (' or ").
        2. Immutable i.e cannot be changed.
        3. Can be assigned to a variable.
Variable: 1. Used to store data.
          2. Can be changed even during program execution.
          3. Stores almost all data types and structures.
          4. A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores. 
             A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character and cannot start with a number.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3. Describe three different data types.

Ans:
  1. String (Text type)
     Enclosed within quotes.
     Immutable.
     eg : "String", "#12-8"
  2. Integer, Float, Complex (Numeric Type)
     int --> 23, 67
     float --> 2.76, .9, .3e7
  3. bool (Boolean type)
     True(1),False(0)   

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4. What is an expression made up of? What do all expressions do?

Ans:
  An expression is made up of values, variables, operators that can evaluate or represent a value as per the precedence of its operators.
  Expressions are used mostly to compute and write or return a value.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

5. This assignment statements, like spam = 10. What is the difference between an expression and a statement?

Ans:
  An Expression always evaluates to a value. Every expression canâ€™t be a statement.
  Statements represent an action or command e.g print statements, assignment statements. Every statement can be an expression.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

6. After running the following code, what does the variable bacon contain?
bacon = 22
bacon + 1

Ans:
Variable bacon contains 22 as the operation was not saved.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

7. What should the values of the following two terms be?
'spam' + 'spamspam'
'spam' * 3

Ans:
Both the operations give the same output --> 'spamspamspam'

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

8. Why is eggs a valid variable name while 100 is invalid?

Ans:
A variable name can start with either alphabets or underscore and cannot start with a number.
So "100" is invalid.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

9. What three functions can be used to get the integer, floating-point number, or string version of a value?

Ans:
int(),float(),str()

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

10. Why does this expression cause an error? How can you fix it?
'I have eaten ' + 99 + ' burritos.'

Ans:
Concatenation of a string with integer is not possible. It can be fixed with typecasting.
Either change the type of string to integer or integer to string.
eg: 'I have eaten ' + str(99) + ' burritos'
