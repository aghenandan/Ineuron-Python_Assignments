    "### What is the relationship between def statements and lambda expressions ?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "\n",
    "Def can hold multiple expressions while lambda is a uni-expression function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Def generates a function and designates a name to call it later. Lambda forms a function object and returns it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Def can have a return statement. Lambda can’t have return statements.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "\n",
    "The map() function iterates through all items in the given iterable and executes the function we passed as an argument on each of them.We can pass as many iterable objects as we want after passing the function we want to use. \n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to map(), filter() takes a function object and an iterable and creates a new list. As the name suggests, filter() forms a new list that contains only elements that satisfy a certain condition, i.e. the function we passed returns True.\n",
    "\n",
    "reduce() works differently than map() and filter(). It does not return a new list based on the function and iterable we've passed. Instead, it returns a single value.\n",
    "\n",
    "reduce() works by calling the function we passed for the first two items in the sequence. The result returned by the function is used in another call to function alongside with the next (third in this case), element. This process repeats until we've gone through all the elements in the sequence. "
